1. Visit the official Python website at [www.python.org](https://www.python.org/) and click on the **Download Python** button. The website will automatically suggest the latest version suitable for your system.
2. Once the installer is downloaded, run it by double-clicking the file.
3. In the installation window, ensure you select the **`Add Python to PATH`** checkbox ‚Äî this is crucial for running Python from the command line.
4. Continue clicking **Next** through the installation steps, leaving everything else as default.

2. In the command prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

3. You should see the installed version of Python printed out, confirming that Python is installed correctly.

### Step 3: Install NumPy
To install NumPy, you'll need to ensure that `pip`, Python‚Äôs package installer, is up to date:
1. In the command prompt, press `Ctrl + Z` or `Ctrl + C` to return to the terminal, then type:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
     ![Upgrade PIP](../assets/pipUpgrade.png)

2. Now, install NumPy by running:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

3. After installation, verify it by running Python and importing NumPy:
    ```bash
    python
    import numpy as np
    ```

If no errors occur, NumPy has been installed successfully! ‚úÖ

> **Troubleshooting Tip:**  
> If you encounter errors, try upgrading `setuptools`:
> ```bash
> pip install --upgrade setuptools
> ```
> Then, repeat the NumPy installation steps.

## üîß Installing Jupyter Notebook and Pandas

Now that Python and NumPy are set up, let‚Äôs proceed with installing **Jupyter Notebook** and **Pandas**. These tools are essential for data analysis and visualization, making them must-haves for any data science environment.

---

### Step 4: Install Jupyter Notebook
1. In the same command prompt, install Jupyter Notebook by running:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
    
    ![notebookInstalling](../assets/notebookInstalling.png)

2. Once the installation is complete, launch Jupyter Notebook by typing:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
This command will open the Jupyter interface in your browser, where you can create new notebooks and run Python code interactively.

### Step 5: Install Pandas
1. After installing Jupyter Notebook, install **Pandas** by running:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

2. Verify that Pandas is installed correctly by creating a new notebook in Jupyter and running the following code:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    print(pd.__version__)
    ```
